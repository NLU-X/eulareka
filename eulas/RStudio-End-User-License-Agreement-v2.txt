or services provided, or any other amounts for any reason. You shall be responsible for taxes levied on any transaction under this

6.1 Confidential Information. During the term of this Agreement, each party will regard any information provided to it by the other
party and designated in writing as proprietary or confidential to be confidential (“Confidential Information”). Confidential
Information shall also include information which, to a reasonable person familiar with the disclosing party's business and the industry
in which it operates, is of a confidential or proprietary nature. A party will not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to
any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, nor make use of any of the other party’s Confidential
Information except in its performance under this Agreement. Each party accepts responsibility for the actions of its agents or
employees and shall protect the other party’s Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own valuable
confidential information, but in no event shall less than reasonable care be used. The parties expressly agree that the Software and
the terms and pricing of this Agreement are the Confidential Information of RStudio. A receiving party shall promptly notify the
disclosing party upon becoming aware of a breach or threatened breach hereunder, and shall cooperate with any reasonable request
of the disclosing party in enforcing its rights.

from the disclosing party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes known to the receiving party from a source other
than one having an obligation of confidentiality, directly or indirectly, to the disclosing party; (iii) becomes publicly known or
otherwise publicly available, except through a breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party
without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. The receiving party may disclose Confidential
Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law (including without limitation applicable state or federal regulations
which may require you to make disclosure pursuant to and as limited by such regulations, such as freedom of information
regulations), legal process or government regulation, provided that it gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice to
permit the disclosing party to contest such disclosure, and such disclosure is otherwise limited to the required disclosure.

6.3 Specific Performance. If the receiving party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in

breach of this Section 6, the disclosing party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek
injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, without the posting of a bond or other security, it being specifically acknowledged by the
parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.

to you only to the extent such limitations or exclusions are permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located.

from and against any and all third party claims asserted against you by a third party (“Third Party Claims”) alleging infringement by
the Software of the third party’s intellectual property rights arising under United States law or the laws of a country party to the
Berne Convention and RStudio shall indemnify and hold you harmless from all damages finally awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction or pursuant to binding arbitration or agreed to by RStudio in settlement with respect to such Third Party Claims.

allegation that does not state with specificity that the Software is the basis of the Third Party Claims; (ii) the use or combination of
the Software or any part thereof with software, hardware, or other materials not developed by RStudio if the Software or use
thereof would not infringe without such combination, (iii) modification of the Software by a party other than RStudio or its

sole liability and your exclusive remedy for claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights.

9.2 You agree to defend (at your expense) RStudio and its officers, directors and employees from and against any and all third party
claims asserted against any or all of them, and you shall indemnify and hold RStudio harmless from all losses, costs and expenses

you in settlement with respect to such claims, which claims arise out of or relate to (a) your and your Users use of the Software that
is not in compliance with this Agreement or the Documentation, or (b) your Customer Applications, including any claim that your
Customer Applications infringe any intellectual property rights of a third party arising under United States law or the laws of a
country party to the Berne Convention or defames any third party or violates their rights of publicity or privacy.

written notice promptly upon learning of any claim for which it seeks indemnification (provided, that any failure to provide prompt
notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations except to the extent the indemnifying party was prejudiced by such
failure); (ii) providing the indemnifying party sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim, provided the indemnifying
party may not settle the claim in a manner adverse to the indemnified party or which would impose liability on the indemnified
party without the indemnified party’s prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iii) providing
the indemnifying party with assistance in the defense and settlement of the claim at the indemnifying party’s expense. The
indemnified may (at its own cost) engage its own counsel to participate in the defense and settlement of the claim.

PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH
HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL
LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU

provisions of Sections 1, 6, 7, 8.2, 9, 10, 11.3 and 13) shall survive such termination.

12. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND

This Section 12 applies to all acquisitions of the Software by or for the federal government, or by any prime contractor or
subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, cooperative agreement or other activity with the federal government. The
Software was developed at private expense and is Commercial Computer Software, as defined in Section 12.212 of the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR 12.212 (October 1995)) and Sections 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (48 CFR 227.7202-1, 227.7202-3 (June 1995)). Accordingly, any use, duplication or disclosure by the
Government or any of its authorized users is subject to restrictions as set forth in this standard license agreement for the Software.
If for any reason, Sections 12.212, 227.7202-1 or 227.7202-3 are deemed not applicable, then the Government's rights to use,
duplicate or disclose the Software are limited to "Restricted Rights" as defined in 48 CFR Section 52.227-19(c)(1) and (2) (June 1987),
or DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(14) (June 1995), as applicable. If this Agreement fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in
any respect with Federal law, the government agrees to return the Software, unused, to RStudio at the address set forth above.

13. General

13.1 This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without giving effect to
principles of conflict of laws. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts sitting in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the federal courts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to resolve any disputes arising under
this Agreement. In each case this Agreement shall be construed and enforced without regard to the United Nations Convention on
the International Sale of Goods.

13.2 Neither party may assign or allow the assumption of any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety (including all Order Forms), without consent of the other party, to its Affiliate
or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, stock or business
to which this Agreement relates to the third party purchasing such stock or assets who agrees in writing to be bound hereby. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.

13.3 This Agreement, all documents referenced herein, and the Order Form(s) entered into by the parties contains the complete
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements
or understandings, whether oral or written. You agree that any varying or additional terms contained in any purchase order or other
written notification or document issued by you in relation to the Software licensed hereunder shall be of no effect and all such
terms or conditions shall be null and void. You acknowledge and agree that your agreement hereunder is not contingent upon the

delivery of any future functionality or features not specified herein or in an Order Form or dependent upon any oral or written,
public or private comments made by RStudio or any Reseller, dealer or agent with respect to future functionality or features for the
Software. In the event of any conflict between the provisions in this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form
shall prevail. The failure or delay of RStudio to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement or upon any breach of this Agreement
shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights or of the breach. No Reseller or RStudio dealer or agent is authorized to make any
amendment to this Agreement. The parties may amend this Agreement by mutual written agreement executed by duly authorized
representatives of the parties. The parties agree that there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Neither party shall be
deemed to be an employee, agent or other legal representative of the other party for any purpose whatsoever, or have the right or
authority to assume or otherwise create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied on behalf of the other party or to bind
the other party in any manner whatsoever.

13.4 If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law that provision will be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. A
waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall not waive such
term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

13.5 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including counterparts delivered by facsimile or other electronic means),
which taken together shall form one legal instrument. The titles of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and are not to be considered in construing this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise:
