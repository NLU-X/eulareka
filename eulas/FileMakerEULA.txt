FILEMAKER SERVER SOFTWARE LICENSE

IMPORTANT -- READ CAREFULLY: BY INSTALLING, COPYING,
DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE
THE SOFTWARE, AND PROMPTLY RETURN IT (IF APPLICABLE) TO YOUR
PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND.

IF YOU LICENSED THIS SOFTWARE UNDER A FILEMAKER VOLUME
LICENSE AGREEMENT, THEN THE TERMS OF SUCH AGREEMENT WILL
SUPERSEDE THESE TERMS, AND THESE TERMS DO NOT CONSTITUTE THE
GRANTING OF AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE.

The software and documentation accompanying this License ("Software") are licensed,
not sold, to you by F ileMaker, Inc. and/ or F ileMaker International (collectively referred
to as "FMI") for use only under the terms of this License, and FMI reserves any rights not
expressly granted to you. The rights granted are limited to F Ml's and its licensors'
intellectual property rights in the Software and do not include any other patents or
intellectual property rights. You own the media on which the Software is recorded or
ﬁxed, but FMI and its licensors retain ownership of the Software itself.

If you received a trial version of the Software for your limited evaluation, it is
programmed to cease functioning on a certain date, Section 1(0) below is modiﬁed to
allow you to use twenty- ﬁve (25) user connections during the trial period, and Section 5
below is modiﬁed so that the trial version of the Software is provided "AS IS" and
without warranty of any kind. The other terms below apply to both the trial and full
versions of the Software. Upon expiration of the trial Software, unless you have paid for
the full or upgrade version of the Software you must immediately discontinue use of the
trial Software.

1. License.

(a) General License. The Software includes the following components: database
server, web publishing engine, web server module, script engine, and ODBC/JDBC
connectivity APIs. You may either (1) install all the Software components on a single
computer, or (2) install the web publishing engine component on one computer and all
the other components on one other computer. You may also install all the Software
components on one additional computer for the sole purpose of conﬁguring it as a
standby server when paired with a primary server using FMl’s standby server
technology. You may not use or run more than one instance of the Software from the
same operating system (e.g., using Virtualization or other technologies) at the same time.

(b) Client Drivers. The F ileMaker ODBC/JDBC "Client Drivers" are the driver
portions of the Software that allow third party applications or custom applications to
access FileMaker Server as an ODBC or J DBC data source. You may copy and distribute
the Client Drivers for use on more than one computer, provided that the Client Drivers
may only be used with the Software.

(c) User Access. The Software includes the rights to access data stored in the
database server using the FileMaker WebDireot web browser client, the F ileMaker Pro
(for User Connections) client, and the FileMaker Go client (collectively “Client(s)”). You
are required to purchase appropriate access for all users that will access the Software. If
you are purchasing access to the Software under the User Connections model, you must
purchase separate access for each individual user that will access the Software. If you are
purchasing access to the Software under the Concurrent Connections model, you must
purchase individual access for the maximum number of users that will concurrently
access FileMaker Server at any given time. Each user may connect to the Software using
only one Client at a time. In the case of FileMaker WebDirect each web browser tab open
and connected to FileMaker Server counts as a separate Client. If one user accesses
multiple FileMaker Servers using a single Client, a user connection is required for each
FileMaker Server accessed by that user. When you purchase FileMaker Server Software,
you receive one concurrent connection access to use for evaluation purposes and this
concurrent connection cannot be used in a production environment. The foregoing
notwithstanding, each full version of FileMaker Pro (“Computer License”) purchased
allows access to FileMaker Server for the computer on which a Computer License is
installed and such access does not count against any other user access model you may
have purchased.

((1) Annual Licenses and Limited Term Licenses. If you license the Software
under an annual license or other limited term license (e.g., Annual Volume License
Agreement or Annual Site License Agreement), then you may only use the Software
during the term of the license agreement, and you must cease all use of the Software upon
the expiration of your license agreement.

(e) Backup. You may make one copy of the Software in machine readable form
solely for backup purposes. As an express condition of this License, you must reproduce

on each copy any copyright notice or other proprietary notice that is on the original copy
supplied by FMI.

(f) Upgrades & Updates. If the Software is licensed as a version or feature upgrade
or update, then you may only use the Software to replace a validly licensed version of the
same software. You agree that the upgrade or update does not constitute the granting of a
second license to the Software (i.e., you may not use the upgrade or update in addition to
the software it is replacing, nor may you transfer the software which is being replaced to

a third party).

(g) Education. If the Software is licensed at an education discount, then the
Software may only be used by enrolled students, faculty, teachers and administrators at
an accredited K-12 educational institution (or equivalent) or higher education institution
exclusively for educational purposes.

2. Restrictions.

(a) FileMaker Server Development License. If you have licensed the FileMaker
Server Development License then your use of this Software is limited to the Maximum
Number of FileMaker Pro, ODBC/JDBC, FileMaker Go clients and FileMaker
WebDireot clients and the Maximum Number of Web Sessions as speciﬁed for the
Development License. In addition, the Software provided under the Development License
may only be used for development and testing purposes and it may not be used in a
production environment.

(b) Other Limitations. YOU MAY NOT REVERSE ENGINEER, DECOMPILE
OR DISASSEMBLE THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOU MAY NOT MODIFY,
ADAPT, TRANSLATE, RENT, LEASE, LOAN OR CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS

RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE TO ANOTHER PARTY WITHOUT FMI'S PRIOR

(f) Commercial Hosting Restrictions. If you provide commercial hosting, you
may only allow one customer to access each Software license. You must obtain at least
one FileMaker Server Software license for each customer that you provide hostin g
services. You may not use the Software to provide any commercial hosting if you license
the Software under FMI’s Site License Agreement or Annual Site License Agreement.

3. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. This License will
terminate automatically without notice from FMI or judicial resolution if you fail to
comply with any provision of this License. If you license the Software under an annual
license or limited term license, then your licenses will immediately terminate and you
must cease all use of the Software upon the expiration of your license, unless you have
paid to renew the license prior to its expiration. Upon such termination you must destroy
the Software, all accompanying written materials and all copies thereof, and Sections 5,
